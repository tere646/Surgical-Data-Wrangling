************* Description *****************
*******************************************
This files contains the necessary information for navigating the different project files.

*******************************************
************* Datasets ********************
*******************************************
There are several data files available for reviewing:
1. Inpatient files can be found on GitHub
2. Beneficiary files are also found on GitHub

These files will need to be put into the Data_File folder in the zip file in order to run the Jupyter Notebook.

3. Consolidated / final datasets exist in both the Zip file as well as GitHub.

These files are our final filtered datasets and/or concatenated files from above as space is a premium for running the notebook all the way through. Performance issues might be seen if datasets are not cleaned up. This code is built into the notebook.

*******************************************
************ Documents ********************
*******************************************
1. Final presentations
2. References
3. General project artifacts

All these documents can be found on GitHub and/or the zip folder under the Document sub-folder.

*******************************************
************ Directions *******************
*******************************************

Use the jupyter notebook to execute the code and review the process and final results. In order to get additional context and background, review the provided documents.
